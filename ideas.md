## Functionality

### To-do's (in order of priority)

- Add a proper loading animation

- Add profile picture upload option for users

- Games/social features:

  - Music quiz that is generated based on the users preferences
  - Queue for in-person listening sessions with voting
  - (Minigames like "guess the song based on the lyrics")

- In the end, go through and remove console logs (at least those exposing private info)
